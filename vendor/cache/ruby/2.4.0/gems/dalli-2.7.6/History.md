2.7.2
==========

- The fix for #423 didn't make it into the released 2.7.1 gem somehow.

2.7.1
==========

- Rack session will check if servers are up on initialization (arthurnn, #423)
- Add support for IPv6 addresses in hex form, ie: "[::1]:11211" (dplummer, #428)
- Add symbol support for namespace (jingkai #431)
- Support expiration intervals longer than 30 days (leonid-shevtsov #436)

2.7.0
==========

- BREAKING CHANGE:
  Dalli::Client#add and #replace now return a truthy value, not boolean true or false.
- Multithreading support with dalli\_store:
  Use :pool\_size to create a pool of shared, threadsafe Dalli clients in Rails:
```ruby
    config.cache_store = :dalli_store, "cache-1.example.com", "cache-2.example.com", :compress => true, :pool_size => 5, :expires_in => 300
```
  This will ensure the Rails.cache singleton does not become a source of contention.
  **PLEASE NOTE** Rails's :mem\_cache\_store does not support pooling as of
Rails 4.0.  You must use :dalli\_store.

- Implement `version` for retrieving version of connected servers [dterei, #384]
- Implement `fetch_multi` for batched read/write [sorentwo, #380]
- Add more support for safe updates with multiple writers: [philipmw, #395]
  `require 'dalli/cas/client'` augments Dalli::Client with the following methods:
  * Get value with CAS:            `[value, cas] = get_cas(key)`
                                   `get_cas(key) {|value, cas| ...}`
  * Get multiple values with CAS:  `get_multi_cas(k1, k2, ...) {|value, metadata| cas = metadata[:cas]}`
  * Set value with CAS:            `new_cas = set_cas(key, value, cas, ttl, options)`
  * Replace value with CAS:        `replace_cas(key, new_value, cas, ttl, options)`
  * Delete value with CAS:         `delete_cas(key, cas)`
- Fix bug with get key with "Not found" value [uzzz, #375]

2.6.4
=======

- Fix ADD command, aka `write(unless_exist: true)` (pitr, #365)
- Upgrade test suite from mini\_shoulda to minitest.

gem 'RubyInline'

  to your Gemfile to get a 10% speedup when using many servers.
  You will see no improvement if you are only using one server.

- More get_multi performance optimization [xaop, #315]

=======

- Don't escape non-ASCII keys, memcached binary protocol doesn't care. [#257]
- :dalli_store now implements LocalCache [#236]
- Removed lots of old session_store test code, tests now all run without a default memcached server [#275]
- Changed Dalli ActiveSupport adapter to always attempt instrumentation [brianmario, #284]
- Change write operations (add/set/replace) to return false when value is too large to store [brianmario, #283]

- Add NODELAY to TCP socket options [#206]

2.0.4

- DalliStore#fetch called the block if the cached value == false [#205]
- DalliStore should have accessible options [#195]
- Add silence and mute support for DalliStore [#207]
- Tracked down and fixed socket corruption due to Timeout [#146]

2.0.3

2.0.1
=======

- Fix nil option handling in dalli\_store#write [#188]

2.0.0
=======

- Reimplemented the Rails' dalli\_store to remove use of
  ActiveSupport::Cache::Entry which added 109 bytes overhead to every
  value stored, was a performance bottleneck and duplicated a lot of
  functionality already in Dalli.  One benchmark went from 4.0 sec to 3.0
  sec with the new dalli\_store. [#173]
- Added reset\_stats operation [#155]
- Added support for configuring keepalive on TCP connections to memcached servers (@bianster, #180)

Notes:

  * data stored with dalli\_store 2.x is NOT backwards compatible with 1.x.
    Upgraders are advised to namespace their keys and roll out the 2.x
    upgrade slowly so keys do not clash and caches are warmed.
    `config.cache_store = :dalli_store, :expires_in => 24.hours.to_i, :namespace => 'myapp2'`
  * data stored with plain Dalli::Client API is unchanged.
  * removed support for dalli\_store's race\_condition\_ttl option.
  * removed support for em-synchrony and unix socket connection options.
  * removed support for Ruby 1.8.6
  * removed memcache-client compability layer and upgrade documentation.


1.1.5
=======

- Coerce input to incr/decr to integer via #to\_i [#165]
- Convert test suite to minitest/spec (crigor, #166)
- Fix encoding issue with keys [#162]
- Fix double namespacing with Rails and dalli\_store. [#160]

1.1.4

- Extend DalliStore's :expires\_in when :race\_condition\_ttl is also used.
- Fix :expires\_in option not propogating from DalliStore to Client, GH-136
- Added support for native Rack session store.  Until now, Dalli's
  session store has required Rails.  Now you can use Dalli to store
  sessions for any Rack application.

    require 'rack/session/dalli'
    use Rack::Session::Dalli, :memcache_server => 'localhost:11211', :compression => true

1.1.3
=======

- Support Rails's autoloading hack for loading sessions with objects
  whose classes have not be required yet, GH-129
- Support Unix sockets for connectivity.  Shows a 2x performance
  increase but keep in mind they only work on localhost. (dfens)

1.1.2
=======

- Fix incompatibility with latest Rack session API when destroying
  sessions, thanks @twinge!

=======

 - Allow browser session cookies (blindsey)
 - Compatibility fixes (mwynholds)
 - Add backwards compatibility module for memcache-client, require 'dalli/memcache-client'.  It makes
   Dalli more compatible with memcache-client and prints out a warning any time you do something that
   is no longer supported so you can fix your code.

1.0.0
=======

Welcome gucki as a Dalli committer!

 - Fix network and namespace issues in get_multi (gucki)
 - Better handling of unmarshalling errors (mperham)

0.11.2
=======

 - Major reworking of socket error and failover handling (gucki)
 - Add basic JRuby support (mperham)

0.11.1
======

 - Minor fixes, doc updates.
 - Add optional support for kgio sockets, gives a 10-15% performance boost.

0.11.0
======

Warning: this release changes how Dalli marshals data.  I do not guarantee compatibility until 1.0 but I will increment the minor version every time a release breaks compatibility until 1.0.

IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED YOU FLUSH YOUR CACHE BEFORE UPGRADING.

 - multi() now works reentrantly.
 - Added new Dalli::Client option for default TTLs, :expires_in, defaults to 0 (aka forever).
 - Added new Dalli::Client option, :compression, to enable auto-compression of values.
 - Refactor how Dalli stores data on the server.  Values are now tagged
   as "marshalled" or "compressed" so they can be automatically deserialized
   without the client having to know how they were stored.

0.10.1
======

 - Prefer server config from environment, fixes Heroku session store issues (thanks JoshMcKin)
 - Better handling of non-ASCII values (size -> bytesize)
 - Assert that keys are ASCII only

0.10.0
======

Warning: this release changed how Rails marshals data with Dalli.  Unfortunately previous versions double marshalled values.  It is possible that data stored with previous versions of Dalli will not work with this version.

IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED YOU FLUSH YOUR CACHE BEFORE UPGRADING.

 - Rework how the Rails cache store does value marshalling.
 - Rework old server version detection to avoid a socket read hang.
 - Refactor the Rails 2.3 :dalli\_store to be closer to :mem\_cache\_store.
 - Better documentation for session store config (plukevdh)

0.9.10
----

 - Better server retry logic (next2you)
 - Rails 3.1 compatibility (gucki)


0.9.9
----

 - Add support for *_multi operations for add, set, replace and delete.  This implements
   pipelined network operations; Dalli disables network replies so we're not limited by
   latency, allowing for much higher throughput.

    dc = Dalli::Client.new
    dc.multi do
      dc.set 'a', 1
      dc.set 'b', 2
      dc.set 'c', 3
      dc.delete 'd'
    end
 - Minor fix to set the continuum sorted by value (kangster)
 - Implement session store with Rails 2.3.  Update docs.

0.9.8
-----

 - Implement namespace support
 - Misc fixes


0.9.7
-----

 - Small fix for NewRelic integration.
 - Detect and fail on older memcached servers (pre-1.4).

0.9.6
-----

 - Patches for Rails 3.0.1 integration.

0.9.5
-----

 - Major design change - raw support is back to maximize compatibility with Rails
 and the increment/decrement operations.  You can now pass :raw => true to most methods
 to bypass (un)marshalling.
 - Support symbols as keys (ddollar)
 - Rails 2.3 bug fixes


0.9.4
-----

 - Dalli support now in rack-bug (http://github.com/brynary/rack-bug), give it a try!
